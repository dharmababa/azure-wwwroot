braced for more violence after 'massacre' of Morsi 
supporters","excerptText":"Egyptians are braced for new violence after at least 
51 supporters of the deposed president Mohamed Morsi were killed by security 
forces in what the Muslim Brotherhood condemned as a massacre but the military 
insisted was the result of an armed attack on a Cairo barracks.&lt;p&gt;The 
country's single bloodiest incident in over a year took place outside a 
Republican Guard officers' club where Morsi is rumoured to be in detention. The 
Brotherhood said its people were attacked during morning prayers but the army 
said an attempt had been made by \"a terrorist group\" to storm the heavily 
guarded building. Emergency services confirmed 435 people were 
injured.&lt;p&gt;Egypt's interim presidency announced a judicial investigation 
into the killings but that did not appease angry crowds who were still massing 
as night fell at the nearby Rabaa al-Adwiya mosque, a focal point for pro-Morsi 
protests. The US said it was \"deeply concerned\" and called on Egypt's military 
to \"exercise maximum restraint\".&lt;p&gt;Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, head of the 
al-Azhar mosque, and the country's senior Muslim cleric, warned of the danger of 
\"civil war\" and said he was going into seclusion until violence ended and 
reconciliation began.&lt;p&gt;Injured victims described how shooting began hours 
after hundreds of thousands of people attended rival rallies for and against 
Morsi across the country. The deaths blocked attempts to form a new civilian-led 
transitional government and fuelled already high tensions on the eve of the 
Ramadan holiday.&lt;p&gt;\"There were dawn prayers and then I heard someone 
calling for help,\" Mohamed Saber el-Sebaei told the Guardian. \"Just before we 
finished, the shooting started. The army units that were standing in front of 
the Republican Guard headquarters first started shooting teargas, then live 
ammunition above people's heads.&lt;p&gt;\"People started to fall back and then 
an armoured vehicle came round the right-hand side escorted by a group of 
soldiers with their rifles shooting directly into the people. I was taking cover 
… behind some rubble and I felt something hit my head.\"&lt;p&gt;Initial claims 
that there were women and children among the dead were not confirmed. But a 
doctor running a field hospital called the three hours he had spent treating 
casualties some of the worst he had experienced in his life.&lt;p&gt;The army 
said an \"armed terrorist group\" had tried to break into the compound and 
attacked security forces. Two policemen and an army officer died and 40 soldiers 
were injured, including seven who were in critical c

FRAN&shy;CIS&shy;CO — Asiana Air&shy;lines says the pilot of the ill-fated 
Boe&shy;ing 777 that crashed here Sat&shy;ur&shy;day had lit&shy;tle 
expe&shy;ri&shy;ence fly&shy;ing the air&shy;craft and was land&shy;ing one for 
the first time at San Fran&shy;cis&shy;co Inter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al when it 
slammed into the run&shy;way, killing two teenaged pas&shy;sen&shy;gers and 
injur&shy;ing more than half the 307 pas&shy;sen&shy;gers and 
crew.&lt;p&gt;Air&shy;lines spokes&shy;woman Lee Hyomin said Mon&shy;day that 
Lee Gang-guk, who was at the con&shy;trols of Sat&shy;ur&shy;day's near&shy;ly 
10 1/2 hour flight from Seoul as it arrived at SFO, was a vet&shy;er&shy;an 
pilot with near&shy;ly 10,000 hours fly&shy;ing other planes. But he had only 43

accord&shy;ing to an air&shy;line spokes&shy;woman, and was assist&shy;ed on 
this flight by deputy pilot Lee Jeong-min. South Kore&shy;an trans&shy;port 
offi&shy;cial said the deputy had about 12,390 hours of fly&shy;ing 
expe&shy;ri&shy;ence, includ&shy;ing 3,220 on the 777.&lt;p&gt;Nation&shy;al 
Trans&shy;porta&shy;tion Safe&shy;ty Board Chair&shy;man Deb&shy;o&shy;rah

train&shy;ing cap&shy;tain, anoth&shy;er cap&shy;tain and a first 
offi&shy;cer.&lt;p&gt;San Fran&shy;cis&shy;co Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White said 
it was \"a pos&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty\" that one of the teens sur&shy;vived 
the crash but was killed on the tar&shy;mac by a vehi&shy;cle dri&shy;ven by one 
of the first-responders at the scene.&lt;p&gt;\"One of our fire 
appa&shy;ra&shy;tus may have come into con&shy;tact with one of our two 
vic&shy;tims who was at the scene,\" Hayes-White said dur&shy;ing a news 
con&shy;fer&shy;ence. \"I assure you we are look&shy;ing close&shy;ly at 
this.\"&lt;p&gt;The two teens, Ye Mengyuan and Wang Lin&shy;jia were from 
China's east&shy;ern Zhe&shy;jiang province and were 29 middle-school 
stu&shy;dents and five teach&shy;ers head&shy;ing for a three-week church 
sum&shy;mer camp in Los Ange&shy;les. Both were declared dead at the 
acci&shy;dent scene. The body of the one who may have been struck by an 
emer&shy;gency vehi&shy;cle was found on the left side of the air&shy;craft 
about 30 feet away from where it came rest.San Mateo Coun&shy;ty coro&shy;ner 
Robert Fou&shy;crault said an autop&shy;sy was expect&shy;ed to be 
com&shy;plet&shy;ed Mon&shy;day. The other vic&shy;tim was found on the 
run&shy;way near the plane's tail, ripped off dur&shy;ing the crash.&lt;p&gt;It 
was the first fatal crash of a com&shy;mer&shy;cial air&shy;line in the USA 
since Feb&shy;ru&shy;ary 2009. Remark&shy;ably, all but two of the 291

train car&shy;ried up to 1 mil&shy;lion gal&shy;lons of crude oil that 
ignit&shy;ed when the train derailed, caus&shy;ing a fire&shy;ball that engulfed

indi&shy;vid&shy;u&shy;als believed to have been at a local bar, Le Musi-Cafe,

death toll to rise once they get to the site of the 
bar.&lt;p&gt;Inves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tors could not reach the bar site because 
of still-smoldering hot spots, he said.&lt;p&gt;The derail&shy;ment caused fires

Testify That Zimmerman Is the One Screaming for Help on 911 
Call","excerptText":"SANFORD, Fla. — Who yelled “help”?&lt;p&gt;As the defense 
continued on Monday to roll out witnesses in the George Zimmerman trial, now 
entering its third week, that question remains a pivotal one. It may also remain 
unanswerable.&lt;p&gt;Several of Mr. Zimmerman’s good friends took the stand to 
say they were sure that the person in distress screaming “help” in the 
background of a 911 call was Mr. Zimmerman, not Trayvon Martin, the teenager he 
shot and killed. Earlier in the trial, the prosecution put several people on the 
stand, including Mr. Martin’s mother, Sybrina Fulton, who said it was Mr. Martin 
screaming for help.&lt;p&gt;“There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that is 
George Zimmerman,” John Donnelly, a friend of Mr. Zimmerman’s who served as a 
combat medic in Vietnam and is now a physician assistant, testified on 
Monday.&lt;p&gt;The two sides have wrangled repeatedly over the issue, which 
could help determine who the aggressor was in the confrontation that led to Mr. 
Martin’s death. On Monday, a recording of the 911 call made by a neighbor was 
played repeatedly in the courtroom.&lt;p&gt;Mr. Zimmerman, 29, is charged with 
second-degree murder in the death of Mr. Martin, an unarmed black teenager who 
was walking to a house where he was a guest on the night of Feb. 26, 
2012.&lt;p&gt;Mr. Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch coordinator for the housing 
complex, claimed that he shot Mr. Martin in self-defense after Mr. Martin 
punched him and repeatedly slammed his head into the pavement. Prosecutors 
maintain that Mr. Zimmerman purposefully followed Mr. Martin and instigated the 
confrontation.&lt;p&gt;The cries for help on the 911 call are distinct. But an 
F.B.I. audio expert said the quality of the recording and the short duration of 
the screams, among other things, made it too difficult to isolate who it was. He 
suggested that a person who is familiar with either Mr. Zimmerman’s or Mr. 
Martin’s voice under similar circumstances might be able to identify the person 
in the call.&lt;p&gt;On the stand, Mr. Donnelly said he had put off listening to 
the entire 911 call until recently because he knew he would find it upsetting. 
But on Saturday, knowing he would have to testify this week, he called up the

throws Greece a €3bn lifeline","excerptText":"Greece's eurozone creditors threw 
the battered country a summer lifeline on Monday evening, deciding to give 
Athens €3bn (£2.58bn) between now and October to prevent a fresh eruption of the 
sovereign debt crisis, while piling the pressure on the government to further 
slash jobs and spending.&lt;p&gt;Greece is to get a new €2.5bn in loans this 
month plus a further €500m in October, a meeting of eurozone finance ministers 
decided. In addition, the European Central Bank is to return €2bn in profits 
earned from Greek bonds while the International Monetary Fund is expected to 
supply €1.8bn in August .&lt;p&gt;With ultimatums and deadlines being set by the 
eurozone in advance of Monday evening's meeting of finance ministers of the 17 
countries, last-minute negotiations resulted in a tentative green light to 
release more bailout funds.&lt;p&gt;Talks over the weekend between the Greek 
government and the troika of officials from the European commission, the 
European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund resulted in a 
last-minute agreement on a new package of spending cuts, job losses and fiscal 
reforms in Greece in return for the bailout funds.&lt;p&gt;But Germany wanted to 
increase the pressure on Athens, hold it to benchmarks on the implementation of 
reforms and calibrate the release of bailout money to tangible 
results.&lt;p&gt;While Pierre Moscovici, the French finance minister, went into 
the meeting expressing his confidence that new loans would be disbursed, his 
German counterpart, Wolfgang Schäuble, made no mention of money, emphasising 
that first the ministers would need to study the fine print of the latest 
troika-Greek government deal.&lt;p&gt;Schäuble said: \"It will remain difficult 
for Greece.\" He added that the latest report on Greece from the troika would be 
\"very precisely assessed.\"&lt;p&gt;The Europeans and the IMF have long been at 
odds on the terms and targets of the Greek bailout, worth €240bn in total, the 
world's biggest, with the IMF worried that Greek national debt levels will 
remain unsustainable.&lt;p&gt;Analysts and officials expect the EU-IMF frictions 
to worsen later in the year, while the Germans are unlikely to soften their hard 
line until general elections in September. A troika statement following the 
negotiations with the government of Antonis Samaras said there were 
\"prospects\" that Greece, in its sixth year of recession, could return to 
growth next year. But \"the outlook remains uncertain.\"&lt;p&gt;Under Monday's 
agreement, Athens has to get to grips with a painful programme of public sector

just started racking up credit card debt again and businesses are 
rejoicing","excerptText":"US con&shy;sumers are bor&shy;row&shy;ing again, and 
that’s a good thing. Real&shy;ly.&lt;p&gt;Con&shy;sumer bor&shy;row&shy;ing rose 
by $19.6 bil&shy;lion in May from April, to a sea&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ly 
adjust&shy;ed level of $2.84 tril&shy;lion.&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the gain came 
from non&shy;re&shy;volv&shy;ing cred&shy;it—a cat&shy;e&shy;go&shy;ry that 
includes stu&shy;dent and auto loans. That cat&shy;e&shy;go&shy;ry jumped by $13 
bil&shy;lion in May. Revolv&shy;ing debt—most&shy;ly cred&shy;it 
cards—post&shy;ed one of the biggest jumps since the most recent reces&shy;sion, 
ris&shy;ing $6.6 bil&shy;lion. That bodes well for both con&shy;sumer 
con&shy;fi&shy;dence and retail sales. Back in the go-go years of 2006 and 2007, 
revolv&shy;ing debt used to increase by an aver&shy;age of $6 bil&shy;lion a 
month. Oh, and for the record, the Fed’s con&shy;sumer debt report released this 
after&shy;noon doesn’t cover the largest cat&shy;e&shy;go&shy;ry of 
Amer&shy;i&shy;can retail bor&shy;row&shy;ing: mort&shy;gages and real estate 
loans. Here’s a look at the revolv&shy;ing and non-revolving 
num&shy;bers.&lt;p&gt;Debt’s got&shy;ten some&shy;thing of a bad name in recent 
years. Vir&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly any uptick in bor&shy;row&shy;ing prompts 
peo&shy;ple to cry bub&shy;ble. And there are some rea&shy;sons for 
con&shy;cern. As we’ve report&shy;ed before, the stag&shy;ger&shy;ing growth in 
stu&shy;dent bor&shy;row&shy;ing has been one of the only areas con&shy;sumer 
bor&shy;row&shy;ing that never shrank in the after&shy;math of the 
finan&shy;cial cri&shy;sis. Here’s a look at the most recent detailed 
quar&shy;ter&shy;ly num&shy;bers, released by the Fed&shy;er&shy;al Reserve back 
in May.&lt;p&gt;But the consumer-driven US econ&shy;o&shy;my runs on 
cred&shy;it, which helps boost growth. Easy access to auto&shy;mo&shy;tive 
cred&shy;it has been one of the key rea&shy;sons the US auto busi&shy;ness is 
going gang&shy;busters at the moment. In June, auto sales hit a 
sea&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ly adjust&shy;ed annu&shy;al&shy;ized rate of near&shy;ly 
16 mil&shy;lion. That’s the best pace for sales since way back in late 2007.
